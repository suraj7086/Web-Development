       <h2>Introduction to Data-Link Layer</h2>
        <p>
           The TCP/IP protocol suite does not define any protocol in the data-link layer or physical layer. These two layers are territories of the networks that when connected make up the internet. These networks, wired or wireless, provide services to the upper three layers of the TCP/IP suite. This may give us a clue that there are several standard protocols in the market today. For this reason, we discuss the data-link layer in several chapters.
        </p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The internet is a combination of networks glued together by connecting devices. If a packet is to travel froma a host to another host, it needs to pass through these networks. Communicationat data-link layer is made up of five separate logical connections between thd data-link layer in the path.</p>
        <h2>
         Nodes and Links
        </h2>
        <p>Communication at data link layer is node-to-node. A data unit from one point in the internet needs to pass through many networks to reach another point. These LANs and WANs are connected by routers. It is customary to refer to the two end hosts and the routers as nodes and the networks in between as links. </p>
        <h2>Services</h2>
        <p>The data-link layer is located between the physical and the network layers. The data-link layer provides services from the physical layer. The duty scope of data-link layer is node to node. when a packet is travelling inthe internet, the data-link layer of a node is responsible for delivering a datagram to the next node in the path. For thsi purpose, the data-link layer of the sending node needs to encapsulate the datagram received from the network in the frame, and the data-link layer of the receiving node needs to decapsulate the datagram from the frame. In other words, the data-link layer of the source host needs only to encapsulate, the data-link layer of the destination host needs to decapsulate, but each immediate node needs to both encapsulate and decapsulate. One may ask why we need encapsulation and decapsulation at each intermediate node. The reason is that each link is using a different protocol with a different frame format. Even if one link and the next are using the same protocol, encapsulation and decapsulation are needed because the link-layer addresses are normally different. An analogy may help in this case. Assume a person needs to travel from her home to her friend's home in another city.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
